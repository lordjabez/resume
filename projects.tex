    \item Migrated to a distributed database to provide high write throughput with eventual consistency that mimicked typical election process for ballot submission, increasing system throughput by an order of magnitude
    \item Implemented a cryptographic process for ensuring vote privacy, secrecy, and integrity that was trusted to run the board of directors election for a multi-billion TODO GET CALPERS SIZE HERE retirement fund
