\project
  {2024}{Workforce Development Ecosystem}
  {\begin{achievements}
    \item Led the team that built a suite of applications implementing a governor's strategic workforce initiative
    \item Supported the jobseeker / employer matching algorithm development, providing ideas for factors to incorporate into the machine learning model, suggestions on optimization include vector store choices, and a mechanism for automated evaluation using large-language models
    \item Developed unemployment insurance features for the application suite, including an automated work-search tracking tool in Amazon Connect and an API wrapper for the mainframe system of record; this work enabled the state to retire older apps with poor user experience and drive adoption of the platform
    \item Researched and integrated a Generative AI solution for natural language querying and visualization creation using joined data from the platform's data lake and publicly available data sets from the Bureau of Labor Statistics; this system directly supported providing outcome data to the governor's office
  \end{achievements}}

\project
  {2020}{Emergency Unemployment Modernization}
  {\begin{achievements}
    \item Designed a cloud-based batch process architecture to insulate an aging AS/400 system from unprecedented user load due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and implemented both a serverless web application (on AWS Lambda) and automated phone system (on Amazon Connect) to collect claimant information using this architecture
    \item Launched minimum viable product in 10 days, which increased throughput of transactions a hundred-fold, and allowed the agency to clear its payment backlog
    \item Sold and led a year-long iterative improvement effort through design conversations with stakeholders, translation to technical requirements, and cross-functional team implementation and deployment
  \end{achievements}}

\project
  {2017}{Online Voting Platform Rewrite}
  {\begin{achievements}
    \item Rearchitected and gradually rewrote a legacy platform through a strangler pattern migration to new microservices running on a multi-zone cloud-based Kubernetes cluster deployed using terraform, achieving 99.998\% uptime over its first year of operation
    \item Migrated to a distributed database to provide high write throughput with eventual consistency that mimicked typical election process for ballot submission, increasing system throughput by an order of magnitude
    \item Implemented a cryptographic process for ensuring vote privacy, secrecy, and integrity that was trusted to host an election of board members for a \$500 billion pension fund
   \end{achievements}}

\project
  {2015}{Voter Registration System Upgrade}
  {\begin{achievements}
    \item Converted legacy code to a new webserver and database platform, saving \$100,000 annually in licensing
    \item Built a zero-downtime deployment system using Jenkins and Chef that pushed updates and ran integration tests across 20+ on-premises locations, reducing turnaround time from hours to seconds; process was used on election day to fix a critical bug without disruption
    \item Designed and sold a multi-year rewrite project based on a consolidation in AWS GovCloud while maintaining each jurisdiction's individual business rules, then hired the cross-functional team to implement and deploy it
  \end{achievements}}
